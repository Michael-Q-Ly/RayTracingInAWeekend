# Ray Tracing in a Weekend

The code I have here is Peter Shirley's. I am just following along with his [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) book series.

Only slight modifications have been made such as making .h files as .hpp files, putting method and function definitions in their own .cpp files, or making my own makefile to build the code.

I'm just here to have fun!
